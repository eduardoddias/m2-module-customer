# Atwix_Customer module

This Magento 2 module was developed according to the requirements detailed in the accompanying PDF document:
[View task description](.readme/taskDescription.pdf "PDF")

The module modifies the customer registration process by validating the "First Name" field during a new customerâ€™s registration.

If the "First Name" field contains any whitespaces, they are removed, ensuring the customer entity is saved with a clean "First Name" attribute.

Once the customer has been successfully registered, a log entry is added to the `var/log/customer_data.log` file:

![log](.readme/log.png "log")

Additionally, an email is sent to the customer support email from the general contact:
![email](.readme/email.png "email")

This behavior is also consistent across other areas, such as the admin panel and REST API.

### Installation details

### Usage
In the admin panel, navigate to Stores > Configuration > General > Store Email Addresses and configure the "General Contact" and "Customer Support" sections.
